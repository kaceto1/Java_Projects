Hello everyone,

these are my java projects based on beginner academic level. The sources that I used for help are university lessons, the book of Rogers Cadenhead "Java in 24 Hours" and youtube channels. Most of the programs contain one file with the main class and one file with the object/framework class with the same name. Each program I was saving in a package named com.java24hours, so If you do not have it or don't want to create one, you can simply ignore the first statement of the code.
